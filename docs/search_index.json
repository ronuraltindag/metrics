Some pep talk on “how to cope with coding frustration”. Best practices relating to code/script development in the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Areas of caution and some never-do’s. 1.2 Course information This is an introductory econometrics course that aims to provide you the basic set of tools to conduct data analysis and interpretation based on economic theory. The focus of the course is the theoretical and empirical foundations of statistical inference and modeling. We will study the basic mechanics of multivariate regression, problems related to its implementation and how to solve them. Towards the end of the semester, subject to a time constraint, we will also discuss issues related to in-sample and out-of-sample prediction problems. The course aims to be application oriented and you should develop, to the extend possible, some programming skills in R. At the end of the semester, I expect you to be familar with RStudio interface, basic data manipulation, obtaining and interpreting the sample statistics, conduct meaningful regression analysis and prediction. Importantly, we will not talk much about the elephant in the room: causal interpretation of any empirical analysis, which is left for the next metrics class that you will take. 1.3 Requirements Textbook: I will mainly use this web page and upload my hand to provide you some material and upload my hand-written lecture notes as well. There are two main textbooks that I heavily rely on to explain the theoretical framework: Studenmund’s Using Econometrics: A Practical Guide. Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach. Feel free to purchase an older edition or rent them. The "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Here is Onur speaking. I would like to add this. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
